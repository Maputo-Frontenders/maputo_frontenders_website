At the time, frontend development was seen as something basic, while most tech communities focused on more advanced languages like Java and Android, promoting complex topics that made it difficult for new developers to enter.",

In addition to popularizing web technologies, the community evolved over time, moving beyond just frontend, becoming a space for software developers in general, bringing together more than a thousand members from different areas, including frontend, backend and other specializations."
